# AddressDetails

The non-portable additional address details that are sometimes needed for compliance, risk, or other scenarios where fine-grain address information might be needed. Not portable with common third party and open source. Redundant with core fields.<br/>For example, `address_portable.address_line_1` is usually a combination of `address_details.street_number`, `street_name`, and `street_type`.
